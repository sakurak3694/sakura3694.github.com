This week was a unique week because we had a midterm exam. We learned what each specific mastery skill is about and what types of things are in that mastery skill for ap computer science. For example mastery skill 1 there is interpreting contracts, applying functions and built-in functions/procedures. So that was for mastery skill 1 but we ms3 and ms5 as well. The most important thing of this week was the midterm exam. It was a good experience to take it but i also realized i need to study and uderstand the things we do in the class better since i did really bad on it. I did not fill everything out since i didnt have enough time and also the last 10 questions i guessed. Therefore i think i should have been more focus so i caould of at least attempted to answer some of the questions that i just guessed. Anyway after we took the test Mrs. Allatta explained how each question is classified in terms of novice, apprentice, prationer and proffesional. The questions i got right most of them were the novice type questions. I got a lot more wrong then i anticipated which i want to try to improve on for the furture.
