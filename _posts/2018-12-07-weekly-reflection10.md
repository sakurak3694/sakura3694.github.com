This week we went back on the idea of choosing a flag but he gave us choices of which flags we can do because some of them are to easy to code i guess. I choose the flag of norway because i went there and it is a very cool and unique place. After i decided to do the norweign flag i went to this website to find the dimensions and porportions. The porportion of my flag is 6:2. Horizontally it was 6:1:2:12, vertically the dimensions are 6:1:2:1:6. The norweign flag is red white and blue similar to the american flag colors. The red is the outside part the blue is the inside recatangle part and then there is a little bit of white beteween the blue and red. The next day we were supposed to make the flag using colored paper,glue,ruler and sicors using the exact same dimensions of our flag. This was a very hard thing because all the measurments had to be precise and i was not so sure how to measure all the parts. I think the teacher noticed that a decent amount of people were not getting much done or was confused like i was. Therefore on thursday we kind of stopped what we were doing with the flags and had a talk with the whole class how making the flags we choose can be a more simple process and we talked about different things that can help us. Personally it was very hard for me to take in count all these measurments and put on paper.
