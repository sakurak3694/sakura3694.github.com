This week was pretty good week for because i sucessfully coded the flag that i choose surprisingly. While coding the Norweign flag i did not do it completely by my self but for most part i did. While coding the flag i first forcused on making the rectangles based on the color and length which is the first half of the code. After i got all the rectangles right i had to combine it in a way that will make the norweign flag. I always kept in consideration that the whole rectangle is 300 to 500 keeping that in mind helped me firgure out the exact location of where i want the rectangele. The hard part about making the flag for me was the second part of the code because you have to combine a lot of rectangles to make a flag. After i got all my numbers set and right i replaced the numbers with words which is the code right below include image. I started with 500 since that is the width after i had numbers like 300 so to get that i wrote width * 3/5 which would get me 300. For 100 i did width * 1/5 since that would get 100. For 150 i was confused at first since no perfect number that is a multiple for 500. So then i just wrote it as a fraction of 3/10 since 500 divided by 10 is 50 and 50 multiplied by 3 gets you 150. So i replaced all these numbers for words with the name. I hope next week i can do what is assigned and understand it.
